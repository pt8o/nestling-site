<p>Long time no chirp! We're going to talk about some of the inspirations behind <i>Nestling</i>.</p>

<p>As you may have gathered from <a href='###'>the trailer</a>, <i>Nestling</i> is a very calm, atmospheric game. There's not a lot of action, and frankly there's not a lot to <i>do</i>. "Collecting" (photographing) the birds is maybe a bit of a conventional game element, but ultimately we want the emphasis to be on the mood and the environment, and the peaceful exploration. Here are some of our main inspirations:</p>

<h2>Lieve Oma</h2>

<p>A charming, wistful, and partly autobiographical game by one-man-studio Florian Veltman, <i>Lieve Oma</i> is about a teenager (the player) picking wild mushrooms with his grandmother, who tries to use the opportunity to get her withdrawn grandchild to open up about some of the recent difficulties he's been facing in his life. It's an earnest and endearingly personal creation, which makes it quite compelling to play even without any conventional "game mechanics."</p>

<p>The low-poly forest setting is also an obvious touchstone for the aesthetics of our game!</p>

<p><i>Lieve Oma</i> is available directly from the developer at <a href='https://vltmn.itch.io/lieve-oma'>itch.io</a>.</p>

<h2>Neko Atsume</h2>

<p>This simple, casual game for mobile devices was an unexpected smash hit, with over 4 million downloads. Is it <i>inspiring</i> though?</p>

<p>We think so! Here's why: developer Yutaka Takazaki stated, "We're not going to put cheats or complexity in it, and we would like to pursue a game that can be enjoyed with only simple operations." Their intent was to produce a game that could be played by children, and completed without a heavy time commitment from the player.</p>

<p>We really love the idea of building a world that a player can enter and leave as they please, with no pressure to complete predetermined goals and no real risks or dangers. It's a nice contrast from the intricately goal-oriented, directive, and sometimes downright stressful atmosphere of most games. <i>Neko Atsume</i> clearly found its audience; we hope we can find ours! </p>

<p><i>Neko Atsume</i> is available on iPhone through the App Store and on Android through Google Play.</p>

<h2>Proteus</h2>

<p><i>Proteus</i> is an exploration game: you just walk. What's interesting about it is that the world itself is generated every time you start a new game, meaning that everyone is walking around their own version of the world.</p>

<p>We found <i>Proteus</i> inspiring because of how beautifully immerseive its lofi world is -- the integration of visual and audio elements is particularly impressive. It also really tastefully used its procedural generation elements; it felt natural and thematically integrated, contrary to how procedural generation often seems tacked-on in other games. Finally, it was basically made by two people (with assistance from 3 others), and it's always inspiring to see small teams create work with such ambition.</p>

<p><i>Proteus</i> is available directly from the developers on <a href='https://twistedtree.itch.io/proteus'>itch.io</a>.</p>

<h2>Walden by Henry David Thoreau</h2>

<p>I believe strongly that drawing inspiration from outside of games makes games more interesting, so I'm including this book by Thoreau in the list, which, for me at least, has informed the overarching concepts behind <i>Nestling</i>.</p>

<p><i>Walden</i> recounts the (probably heavily embellished) tale of Thoreau's two-year stay in self-imposed isolation from civilization in a cabin at Walden Pond. It touches on some broad topics including the unjustness of the state(!), but ultimately it is read and remembered as an ode to wilderness and solitude, and I've been keeping it in mind as we develop our game. <i>Nestling</i> eschews typical "game mechanics" on purpose; we want to create an experience that is immersive and engaging in a very simple, almost still-life environment, without the usual quest for progress that drives most works in this medium.</p>

<p>In recent years <i>Walden</i> <a href='http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/pond-scum'>has been critiqued</a>, quite fairly, for being this romanticized vision of simple living from the perspective of a pretty privileged dude whose "wilderness" was actually a plot of land owned by his friend and who took breaks from exile to head to his parents' place for dinner. (Thoreau, as a personality, seems 100% insufferable.) These complications are worth exploring, and do not detract from the knack that Thoreau possessed for describing the experience of nature.</p>

<p>We'll end with the quote that opens our game's trailer:</p>

<p><blockquote>“Live in each season as it passes; breathe the air, drink the drink, taste the fruit, and resign yourself to the influence of the earth.”</blockquote></p>

<p>See you nest time.</p>
