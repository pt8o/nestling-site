<h2>Hello.</h2>

If you see any mistakes (or just wanna chat) send us a note at chirp[at]nestling-game[dot]com. And, of course, follow us on <a href='https://twitter.com/nestling_game'>Twitter</a> and <a href='https://www.facebook.com/nestling.game'>Facebook</a> to keep up-to-date on our progress.</p>

<p>See you nest time!</p>
