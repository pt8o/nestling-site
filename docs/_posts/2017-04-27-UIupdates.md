<p>We are closing in on our last couple of weeks before our project is due for school, so we are crunching away at our game! So this is a quick update with some GIFs of the game in action.</p>

<p>The audio input UI: the white dot shows the note that the bird sang, and the red dot shows the note you're currently singing.</p>

<p>Crouching and zooming in on a bird that you've successfully coaxed out of hiding:</p>

<p>Sorry for such a short update, we are focusing on making the best game we possibly can and we can't wait to share it with you all! Until nest time...</p>
