<h2>Really though, what is this game all about?</h2>
<p>I've realized we're a couple of months into development and <b>no one knows what this game is about</b>, aside from the really cryptic <i>About</i> section on our home page. So here's our pitch:</p>

<p><i>Nestling</i> is a meditative, ambient game about birdwatching. You walk through a forest, taking in the sights and sounds around you, enjoying a lovely afternoon. Every once in awhile, you'll hear a bird call. You can see the bird, but you can hear it... so you try to coax the bird out of hiding by copying its call by whistling.</p>

<p>That is to say: you, the player, in real life, try to copy the bird call by whistling, in real life.</p>

<p>A microphone picks up your whistle, and the game determines whether you copied the birdsong well. The bird sings to you again, and you whistle back again, and this goes on a few more times. If you did it well, the bird happily emerges from its hiding place and hangs with you for a bit -- maybe eating some seeds from your hand, or letting you pet it. You can take a picture of the bird for your collection. Then the bird flies away, and you continue on your walk, listening for more birds.</p>
<h2>Our inspirations</h2>
<p>All three of us are interested in novel gameplay mechanics, so the idea of using a microphone as a controller was an early idea that we all got excited about. When we got to building a concept around this game, we were inspired by calm, endearing games like the autobiographical <i>Lieve Oma</i>, and the super cute mobile hit <i>Neko Atsume</i> -- games that didn't need complex game mechanics or flashy graphics to still be very captivating and fun.</p>

<h2>Boring technical things for fellow game devs</h2>
<p>Our game is being produced in Unity and coded in CSharp. The 3D assets are primarily being made in Blender, with some use of Unity's tools. The audio is being produced in Ableton Live, with some mixing and post-production in Unity.</p>
<h2>Where we're at</h2>
<p>So far we've got a robust pitch detection script, which was not easy to make (I'll be writing about that next week). We have a fully rigged bird, which was even harder (Ana will tell you about that later on). We've got a basic environment and a preliminary screenshotting mechanic. Things are starting to come together, but we know we've got a lot of work ahead.</p>

<p>Be sure to keep up with us on this devlog, or follow us on <a href='https://www.facebook.com/nestling.game'>Facebook</a> or <a href='https://www.twitter.com/nestling_game'>Twitter</a>! For the next four weeks we'll post twice a week: Mondays will be more in-depth discussions of some of the issues we've faced in our development process, and Thursdays will be short updates or screenshots, more like a conventional devblog. After that, we'll drop down to weekly updates as we enter crunch time on our first playable demo, which we'll be presenting in early May. Thanks for reading and see you nest time!</p>
