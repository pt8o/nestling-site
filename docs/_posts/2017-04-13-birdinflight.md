<h2>This is so cool!</h2>
<p>Ana has been very hard at work and has produced a beautiful "bird in flight" animation completely from scratch. Check it out:</p>

<p>We didn't have our in-depth Monday post this week. In fact, Ana is working on a longer-form post in which she discusses the many difficulties that came up while she was creating this bird. I'm sure it'll be really interesting! For now she's focusing on producing for the game itself, so we'll delay that post for the foreseeable future. Keep an eye out.</p>

<p>Overall, game is really coming together and we're looking forward to sharing more with you! We're waiting for things to be <i>just right</i>, so you'll need to have some patience. Until nest time!</p>
