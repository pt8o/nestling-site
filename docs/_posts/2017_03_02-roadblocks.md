<h2>OK.</h2>

<p>I've been working on a pitch detection script since the beginning of development. Our birdwatching game relies on this for its central mechanic; the main innovation of this game is the use of a microphone inputI burst out the gate with some early progress, first creating an audio visualizer that displayed a graphical representation of the audio spectrum of an audio input. Then I isolated just the frequencies corresponding to the pitches in the common western scale.</p>

<p>It looked amazing! We were so excited that we <a href="https://twitter.com/Nestling_Game/status/836382679662792704">tweeted a screen capture</a> of our visualizer in action, using a nice beat by Mr. Carmack as our audio input. We got a lot of positive response to it. It felt great.</p>

<p>But showing an audioviz of a sick bass drop is a completely different animal from showing</p>

<h2>This was a problem</h2>
