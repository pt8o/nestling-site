<p>I'm very excited to present to you the the beautiful result of a collaboration between Steven and Ana. Let your eyes feast upon the bird part randomizer:</p>

<p>This was captured directly from the Unity editor; no editing tricks! As you can see, we can swap out different bird parts on the fly without disrupting the basic bird movement animations.</p>

<h2>I don't think you're excited enough for how cool this is.</h2>

<p>This allows us to fully randomize the individual parts of the bird, while using the same core animations. We can produce a <b>literally infinite</b> number of birds without having to producing a unique animation for each. Which, as Ana will tell you, is an incredibly painstaking process.</p>

<p>This is not an unusual thing for games with human characters, but it's much more complex with a bird rig and I'm not sure I've come across something this in-depth for birds.</p>

<p>Needless to say <b>we are stoked</b> and we will see you nest time.</p>
