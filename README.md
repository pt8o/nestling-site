<h2>This is a sample blog post to show you how Jekyll works.</h2>

<p>The source for this particular post is the file '&#95;posts/2017-01-31-test-post.md' </p>

<p>You should go take a look at it and compare it to this post!</p>

<p>Firstly, the post needs to have the date in 'yyyy-mm-dd' format at the beginning of its title. This is how Jekyll knows what folder to put the post in. The text that comes after that will be the post's URL.</p>

<p>Inside the file, there's a weird "header" thing. Make sure your post has all of these characteristics filled out and in this exact same formatting (e.g. quotation marks around the title, image file starting with '/nestling-site/'). These is like the metadata of the post that allows it to be recognized by the loop that populates our front page. The header image should be portrait orientation (ratio ~4:3) and should maybe be something abstract-ish; the image will get cropped and resized at different window sizes, so it can't be reliant on perfect framing.</p>

<p>The body text is just text wrapped in <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags. The paragraphs format automatically, just make sure each paragraph is wrapped properly. You can make things <b>bold</b> and <i>italic</i> and also <a href='#'>link things</a>.</p>

<h2>Use h2's for your subheadings.</h2>

<p>Lastly I've done some very basic formatting for images. Link to an image with a &lt;img&gt; tag and it will automatically go to the full width of this container, so I guess make sure it's a decent resolution and that it's portrait orientation.</p>

<img src='/nestling-site/img/bird-example.jpg'>

<h2>OK that's it.</h2>
<p>Sorry if this is super cumbersome but I kind of think it's pretty cool! Let me know if you have any questions.</p>
